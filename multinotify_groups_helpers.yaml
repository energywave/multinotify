group:
  # TODO: you have to define your Home Assistant groups for every speaker group defined in the "Speakers group" at the
  #       end of the page "devices" in the Alexa app.
  #       Rename "ovunque" to your "all speakers" Alexa group name and eventually remove "piani_superiori" if you don't have other Alexa groups.
  #       It's important that every group name must be equal to the corresponding media_player name.
  #       For example: media_player.all_upstairs_alexa must have a corresponding group.all_upstairs_alexa with the same content.
  #       This way multinotify can know who is in the speaker group (as Alexa Media Player don't tell us...)
